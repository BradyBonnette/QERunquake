# QERunquake
Quake Enhanced RuneQuake mod

# What is it?

Good ole RuneQuake. This was modified to work with QE but pretty much the same version. The one I used was version 1.4.21. I am not the original author.

# How to install
Go to your 'Saved games' quake folder, NOT THE STEAM FOLDER. You can go to it by pressing Windows+R and typing: %userprofile%\Saved Games\Nightdive Studios\Quake\Id1
Create a folder called 'id1'
Create another folder and call it 'mpmod'. If you already have this folder, skip this step.
Extract zip into the 'id1' folder you created on step 2. If you already have an 'id1' folder, it's likely from another mod. Unfortunately, you'll have to replace it.
How to run the mod
Open console and type 'game mpmod'
Start a multiplayer game
Technical explanation
When you change to mpmod, it sets the root folder to be Saved Games, so next time the game goes into id1 it will use the files from Saved Games and override.
